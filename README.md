# BCG_virtual_internship
A virtual internship experience from The Boston Consulting Group.

The brief: PowerCo is a gas and electricity provider serving corporate, SME, and residential customers. Due to energy market liberalization in Europe, customer churn has become a significant concern, particularly among SMEs. To address this issue, PowerCo has teamed up with BCG to identify the reasons behind SME churn. One hypothesis is that customers are leaving due to price sensitivity, and it may be possible to predict churn through a predictive model.

Tasks: 
Task 1: Formulate the hypothesis that churn is driven by price sensitivities and design a data science plan to test it, including data needs and analytical models.

Task 2: Clean and explore the data, identifying missing values and outliers, and visualize parameters and variable distributions.

Task 3: Engineer features that could drive churn for the client.

Task 4: Build and evaluate churn models using explanatory variables from feature engineering, selecting an appropriate metric for business outcomes.

Task 5: Synthesize findings into an executive summary slide for the steering committee meeting, considering the head of the SME division and other stakeholders.
